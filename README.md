# node_form_title
Allows you to change the node add and edit form page titles respectively

Simple install the module and edit a content type. You will then be able to set the page titles for new and existing nodes within the additional settings.

The 'Add Title' does not allow the use of tokens, because it is a new node.

The 'Edit Title' allows for the use of tokens, e.g. "Edit my wonderful node - [node:title]".

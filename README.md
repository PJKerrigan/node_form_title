# node_form_title
Allows you to change the node add and edit form page titles respectively

Simple install the module and edit a content type. You will then be able to set the page titles for new and existing nodes within the additional settings.

The 'Add Title' and 'Edit Title' both allow the use of node tokens (e.g. 'Create node of [node:type:label]'), however please bear in mind that a new node will likely have most values blank.
